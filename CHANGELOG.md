### [2.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka/releases/tag/2.0.0)

Pull requests associated with this milestone can be found in this [filter](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A2.0.0%20).

We have made tons of changes in Eureka API to follow the new Swift API design guidelines.
It's hard to enumerate all changes and most of them will be automatically suggested by Xcode.

We have also added to Eureka a extensible build-in validations support.

These are the most important changes...

#### Deleted

* `PostalAddressRow` was removed.
* `ImageRow` was removed.

You can find these both rows under [EurekaCommunity] github organization.

* Row's `func highlightCell()`
* Row's `func unhighlightCell()`
* Cell's `func highlight()`
* Cell's `func unhighlight()`
* Cell's `func didSelect()`

#### Added

* Rows's `var isHighlighted: Bool`.
* Rows's `var isValid: Bool`.
* Row's `func onCellHighlightChanged(_ callback: @escaping (_ cell: Cell, _ row: Self)->()) -> Self `.
* Row's `func onRowValidationChanged(_ callback: @escaping (_ cell: Cell, _ row: Self)->()) -> Self`.
* Row's `func validate() -> [ValidationError]`
* Form's `func validate() -> [ValidationError]`
* Row's `func add<Rule: RuleType>(rule: Rule)`
* Row's `func remove(ruleWithIdentifier: String)`
* `RuleSet<T: Equatable>` type.
* `ValidationOptions` Enum type.
* `RuleType` protocol.
* `ValidationError` type.

##### Fixes

* Fixed textlabel alignment for cells with custom constraints (FieldRow, SegmentedRow, TextAreaRow).
* Set 'Require Only App-Extension-Safe API' to YES to enable code sharing in App Extensions.
* Other bug fixes and minor improvements

### [1.4.1](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka/releases/tag/1.4.1)
Released on 2016-02-25.

##### Breaking Changes

* `SelectorRow` now requires the cell among its generic values. This means it is easier to change the cell for a selector row.
* `_AlertRow` and `_ActionSheetRow` require generic cell parameter

If you are using custom rows that inherit from SelectorRow then you might want to change them as follows (or use your custom cell):
```
// before
// public final class LocationRow : SelectorRow<CLLocation, MapViewController>, RowType
// now
public final class LocationRow : SelectorRow<CLLocation, MapViewController, PushSelectorCell<CLLocation>>, RowType
```


### [1.4.0](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka/releases/tag/1.4.0)

 * PopoverSelectorRow added.
 * BaseRow reload, select, deselect helpers added.
 * ImageRow update: allows clear button, image sources are public
 * Added PostalAddressRow
 * Lots of smaller bug fixes and new documentation

##### Breaking Changes

* `BaseCellType` protocol method `func cellBecomeFirstResponder() -> Bool`  was renamed to `func cellBecomeFirstResponder(direction: Direction) -> Bool`

If you are using custom rows you may have to fix the compiler error by adding the new parameter.

* DecimalRow value type changed from Float to Double.
