GoogleMapsDemos contains a demo application showcasing various features of
the Google Maps SDK for iOS.

Before starting, please note that these demos are directed towards a technical
audience. You'll also need Xcode 7.3 or later, with the iOS SDK 9.3 or later.

If you're new to the SDK, please read the Introduction section of the Google
Maps SDK for iOS documentation-
  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios

Once you've read the Introduction page, follow the first couple of steps on the
"Getting Started" page. Specifically;

  * Obtain an API key for the demo application, and specify the bundle ID of
    this demo application as an an 'allowed iOS app'. By default, the bundle ID
    is "com.example.GoogleMapsDemos".

  * Open the project in Xcode, and update `SDKDemoAPIKey.h` with this key.

If you'd like to add a new sample, add a new subclass of `ViewController` and
add it to the samples definitions inside the `Samples.m`.
