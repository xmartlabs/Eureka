## Introduction

**Eureka!** is a library to create dynamic table-view forms from a [DSL] specification in Swift. This DSL basically consists of *Rows*, *Sections* and *Forms*. A *Form* is a collection of *Sections* and a *Section* is a collection of *Rows*.

If you have been using `XLForm` then many terms will result familiar to you.

Both `Form` and `Section` classes conform to `MutableCollectionType` and `RangeReplaceableCollectionType` protocols. This makes a whole bunch of functions available to be executed on them.

**For more information look at [our blog post] that introduces *Eureka!*.**

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+
* Xcode 7.0+


## Getting involved
* If you **want to contribute** please feel free to **submit pull requests**.
* If you **have a feature request** please **open an issue**.
* If you **found a bug** or **need help** please **check older issues or threads on [StackOverflow] before submitting an issue**.

If you use **Eureka** in your app We would love to hear about it! Drop us a line on [twitter].

## Examples

Follow these 3 steps to run Example project: Clone Eureka repository, open Eureka workspace and run the *Example* project.

You can also experiment and learn with the *Eureka Playground* which is contained in *Eureka.workspace*.

## Usage

### How to create a form
It is quite simple to create a form, just like this:

```swift
import Eureka

class CustomCellsController : FormViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        form +++ Section("Custom cells")
	            	<<< WeekDayRow(){
	            		$0.value = [.Monday, .Wednesday, .Friday]
	            	}
	            	<<< TextFloatLabelRow() {
	            		$0.title = "Float Label Row, type something to see.."
	            	}
    }
}
```

In this example we create a [CustomCellsController] and then simply add a section with two custom rows to the `form` variable.

And this is the product:

<img src="Example/Media/EurekaCustomCells.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Custom Cells"/>

As you may have noticed `CustomCellsController` extends from `FormViewController` which has a `form` property that can be used to declare the form as the example shows.
`WeekDayRow` and `TextFloatLabelRow` are non-standard rows included in the example project, but the standard rows usage is analog. You can create a form by just setting up the `form` property without extending from `FormViewController` but typically it is more convenient to create a custom view controller that extends from it.


### Operators

We declared a series of custom operators to make the creation and modification of forms more readable and appealing.
#### +++=
This operator is used to append a row or section to a form. In case you are appending a row, then a section will be created that contains that row and that section will be appended to the form.

```swift
// Will append a section at the end of the 'form' Form.
form +++= Section()

// Will internally create a Section containing a PhoneRow and append it to the 'form' variable:
form +++= PhoneRow()
```

#### +++
Lets you add a Section to a Form or create a Form by adding two sections. For example:

```swift
// Will add two sections at the end of the 'form' Form.
form +++ Section("Custom cells") +++ Section("Another section")

// Will create and assign a Form to the 'form' variable (containing the two sections):
form = Section("Custom cells") +++ Section("Another section")
```

#### <<<
This one is used to append rows to sections or to create a Section by appending two rows. For example:


```swift
// Will append a Check row to the last section of the 'form' Form.
form.last! <<< CheckRow()

// Will implicitly create a Section and add it to the 'form' (containing the two rows):
form +++ PhoneRow("Phone"){ $0.title = "Phone"}
         <<< IntRow("IntRow"){ $0.title = "Int"; $0.value = 5 }
```


#### +=
This operator just invokes the corresponding `appendContentsOf` method which means that it can be used to append arrays of elements to either a Form or a Section like this:

```swift
// Will append three sections to form.
form += [Section("A"), Section("B"), Section("C")]
```

###### To learn more about these operators try them out in Eureka Playground.


### Rows

This is a list of the rows that are provided by default:

* **Field Rows**
	This rows have a textfield on the right side of the cell. The difference between each one of them consists in a different capitalization, autocorrection and keyboard type configuration.
	+ **TextRow**
	+ **NameRow**
	+ **UrlRow**
	+ **IntRow**
	+ **PhoneRow**
	+ **PasswordRow**
	+ **EmailRow**
	+ **DecimalRow**
	+ **TwitterRow**
	+ **AccountRow**
	+ **ZipCodeRow**


* **Date Rows**
  Date Rows hold a NSDate and allow us to set up a new value through UIDatePicker control. The mode of the UIDatePicker and the way how the date picker view is shown is what changes between them.

  + **DateRow**
  + **DateInlineRow**
  + **TimeRow**
  + **TimeInlineRow**
  + **DateTimeRow**
  + **DateTimeInlineRow**
  + **CountDownRow**
  + **CountDownInlineRow**
  + **DatePickerRow**
  + **TimePickerRow**
  + **DateTimePickerRow**
  + **CountDownPickerRow**


* **Options Selector Rows** These are rows with a list of options associated from which the user must choose. You can see them in the examples above.
	+ **AlertRow**

    <img src="Example/Media/EurekaAlertRow.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Custom Cells"/>

	+ **ActionSheetRow**

		The ActionSheetRow will show an action sheet with options to choose from.

	+ **SegmentedRow**

    <img src="Example/Media/EurekaSegmentedRow.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Segment Row"/>

	+ **PushRow**

		This row will push to a new controller from where to choose options listed using Check rows.

	+ **ImageRow**

		Will let the user pick a photo

	+ **MultipleSelectorRow**

		This row allows the selection of multiple options

	+ **PickerRow**

		This row allows you to present options of a generic type through a picker view

	+ **PickerInlineRow**

		This row uses the **PickerRow** row as its inline row

	+ **LocationRow** (Included as custom row in the example project)

    <img src="Example/Media/EurekaLocationRow.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Location Row"/>


* **Other Rows**
	These are other rows that might be useful
	+ **ButtonRow**
	+ **CheckRow**
	+ **LabelRow**
	+ **SwitchRow**
	+ **TextAreaRow**

There are also some custom rows in the examples project.

### Customization

A *row* holds the basic information that will be displayed on a *cell* like title, value, options (if present), etc. All the stuff that has to do with appearance like colors, fonts, text alignments, etc. normally go in the cell. Both, the row and the cell hold a reference to each other.

You will often want to customize how a row behaves when it is tapped on or when its value changes and you might be interested in changing its appearance as well.
There are many callbacks to change the default appearance and behaviour of a row.

* **onChange()**

	This will be called when the value of a row changes. You might be interested in adjusting some parameters here or even make some other rows appear or disappear.
* **onCellSelection()**

	This one will be called each time the user taps on the row and it gets selected.
* **cellSetup()**

	The cellSetup will be called once when the cell is first configured. Here you should set up your cell with its permanent settings.
* **cellUpdate()**

	The cellUpdate will be called each time the cell appears on screen. Here you can change how the title and value of your row is set or change the appearance (colors, fonts, etc) depending on variables that might not be present at cell creation time.

* **onCellHighlight()**

  The onCellHighlight will be invoked whenever the cell or any subview become the first responder.

* **onCellUnHighlight()**

  The onCellUnHighlight will be invoked whenever the cell or any subview resign the first responder.

* **onExpandInlineRow()**

  The onExpandInlineRow will be invoked before expand the inline row. This does only apply to the rows conforming to the `InlineRowType` protocol.

* **onCollapseInlineRow()**

  The onCollapseInlineRow will be invoked before collapse the inline row. This does only apply to the rows conforming to the `InlineRowType` protocol.

* **onPresent()**

	This method will be called by a row just before presenting another view controller. This does only apply to the rows conforming to the `PresenterRowType` protocol. You can use this to set up the presented controller.

Each row also has an initializer where you should set the basic attributes of the row.

Here is an example:

```swift
let row  = CheckRow("set_disabled") { // initializer
              $0.title = "Stop at disabled row"
              $0.value = self.navigationOptions?.contains(.StopDisabledRow)
           }.onChange { [weak self] row in
              if row.value ?? false {
                  self?.navigationOptions = self?.navigationOptions?.union(.StopDisabledRow)
              }
              else{
                  self?.navigationOptions = self?.navigationOptions?.subtract(.StopDisabledRow)
              }
           }.cellSetup { cell, row in
              cell.backgroundColor = .lightGrayColor()
           }.cellUpdate { cell, row in
              cell.textLabel?.font = .italicSystemFontOfSize(18.0)
           }
```

Now it would look like this:

<img src="Example/Media/EurekaCustomCellDisabled.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Disabled Row"/>

### Section Header and Footer

The UITableView accepts two ways of setting the headers and footers for its sections, one is by using `tableView(tableView: UITableView, viewForHeaderInSection section: Int) -> UIView?` where you have to return a view and the other is `tableView(tableView: UITableView, titleForHeaderInSection section: Int) -> String?` where you return a String. Eureka works the same way, you can set a String or a view as header or footer for a `Section`.

The easiest way of setting a header or a footer is by setting them as a String. This can be done using the following Section initializers:
```
init(_ header: String, @noescape _ initializer: Section -> () = { _ in })
init(header: String, footer: String, @noescape _ initializer: Section -> () = { _ in })
init(footer: String, @noescape _ initializer: Section -> () = { _ in })
```

Using this you can instantiate a Section like `Section("Title")` or `Section(header: "Title", footer: "Footnote")` for example.

You can also set the header or footer using a custom view. This is best done by setting the `header` or `footer` variable of the section. This variables must conform the `HeaderFooterViewRepresentable` protocol. This can be done by using the `HeaderFooterView` class. An example follows:

```
Section() { section in
	var header = HeaderFooterView<MyHeaderNibFile>(.NibFile(name: "MyHeaderNibFile", bundle: nil))        
	header.onSetupView = { view, _, _ in
    	 // customize header
	 }
	header.height = { 100 }

	section.header = header
}
```

The `HeaderFooterView` is a `StringLiteralConvertible` and requires a String or a `HeaderFooterProvider` that will generate the view to show. There are 3 ways a HeaderFooterProvider can create a view: from a nibfile (like in the example), from a class (it will just instantiate that class) or from a block (you can pass a block to the HeaderFooterProvider that returns the view).

```
public enum HeaderFooterProvider<ViewType: UIView> {
	case Class
	case Callback(()->ViewType)
	case NibFile(name: String, bundle: NSBundle?)
}
```


### How to dynamically hide and show rows (or sections)  <a name="hide-show-rows"></a>

Many forms have conditional rows, I mean rows that might appear on screen depending on the values of other rows. You might want to have a SegmentedRow at the top of your screen and depending on the chosen value ask different questions:

<figure>
  <img src="Example/Media/EurekaSwitchSections.gif" width="300" alt="Screenshot of Hidden Rows" />
	<figcaption style="text-align:left;">In this case we are hiding and showing whole sections</figcaption>
</figure>

To accomplish this each row has an `hidden` variable that is of optional type `Condition`.
```swift
public enum Condition {
    case Predicate(NSPredicate)
    case Function([String], (Form?)->Bool)
}
```
The `hidden` variable might be set with a function that takes the form the row belongs to and returns a Bool that indicates whether the row should be hidden or not. This is the most powerful way of setting up this variable as there are no explicit limitations as to what can be done in the function.

Along with the function you have to pass an array with all the tags of the rows this row depends on. This is important so that Eureka can reevaluate the function each time a value changes that may change the result of this function. In fact that will be the only time the function is reevaluated.
You can define it like this:
```swift
<<< AlertRow<Emoji>("tag1") {
        $0.title = "AlertRow"
        $0.optionTitle = "Who is there?"
        $0.options = [💁, 🍐, 👦, 🐗, 🐼, 🐻]
        $0.value = 👦
    }
   // ...
<<< PushRow<Emoji>("tag2") {
        $0.title = "PushRow"
        $0.options = [💁, 🍐, 👦, 🐗, 🐼, 🐻]
        $0.value = 👦
        $0.hidden = Condition.Function(["tag1"]) { form in
                        if let r1 : AlertRow<Emoji> = form?.rowByTag("tag1") {
                            return r1.value == 👦
                        }
                        return false
                    }
      }
```

The `hidden` variable can also be set with a NSPredicate. In the predicate string you can reference values of other rows by their tags to determine if a row should be hidden or visible.
This will only work if the values of the rows the predicate has to check are NSObjects (String and Int will work as they are bridged to their ObjC counterparts, but enums won't work).
Why could it then be useful to use predicates when they are more limited? Well, they can be much simpler, shorter and readable than functions. Look at this example:
```swift
$0.hidden = Condition.Predicate(NSPredicate(format: "$switchTag == false"))
```
And we can write it even shorter since `Condition` conforms to StringLiteralConvertible:
```swift
$0.hidden = "$switchTag == false"
```

*Note: we will substitute the value of the row whose tag is 'switchTag' instead of '$switchTag'*

For all of this to work, **all of the implicated rows must have a tag** as the tag will identify them.

We can also hide a row by doing:
```swift
$0.hidden = true
```
as `Condition` conforms to BooleanLiteralConvertible.

Not setting the `hidden` variable will leave the row always visible.

##### Sections
For sections this works just the same. That means we can set up section `hidden` property to show/hide it dynamically.

##### Disabling rows
To disable rows, each row has an `disabled` variable which is also an optional Condition type property . This variable also works the same as the `hidden` variable so that it requires the rows to have a tag.

Note that if you want to disable a row permanently you can also set `disabled` variable to `true`.

### List sections
It happens quite often when developing apps you want the user to choose among a list of options. Therefore we created a special section that accomplishes this.
These sections are called `SelectableSection`.
When instancing a SelectableSection you have to pass the type of row you will use in the section as well as the type of that row. These sections have a variable called `selectionStyle` that defines if multiple selection is allowed. `selectionStyle` is an enum which can be either `MultipleSelection` or `SingleSelection(enableDeselection: Bool)` where the enableDeselection paramter determines if the selected rows can be deselected or not.

This sections can be created, as it is done in the Examples project, like this:

```
let oceans = ["Arctic", "Atlantic", "Indian", "Pacific", "Southern"]

form +++= SelectableSection<ImageCheckRow<String>, String>("And which of the following oceans have you taken a bath in?", selectionType: .MultipleSelection)

for option in oceans {
    form.last! <<< ImageCheckRow<String>(option){ lrow in
        lrow.title = option
        lrow.selectableValue = option
        lrow.value = nil
    }.cellSetup { cell, _ in
        cell.trueImage = UIImage(named: "selectedRectangle")!
        cell.falseImage = UIImage(named: "unselectedRectangle")!
    }
}
```

##### What kind of rows can be used?
To create such a Section you have to create a row that conforms the `SelectableRowType` protocol.
```
public protocol SelectableRowType : RowType {
    var selectableValue : Value? { get set }
}
```
This `selectableValue` is where the value of the row will be permanently stored. The `value` variable will be used to determine if the row is selected or not, being 'selectableValue' if selected or nil otherwise.

Eureka includes the `ListCheckRow` which is used for example in the SelectorViewController. In the custom rows of the Examples project you can also find the `ImageCheckRow`

##### Helpers
To easily get the selected row of a `SelectableSection` there are two methods: `selectedRow()` and `selectedRows()` which can be called to get the selected row in case it is a `SingleSelection` section or all the selected rows if it is a `MultipleSelection` section.

## Extensibility

### How to create custom rows and cells  <a name="custom-rows"></a>

To create a custom row you will have to create a new class subclassing from `Row<ValueType, CellType>` and conforming to `RowType` protocol.
Take for example the SwitchRow:

```swift
public final class SwitchRow: Row<Bool, SwitchCell>, RowType {

    required public init(tag: String?) {
        super.init(tag: tag)
        displayValueFor = nil
    }
}
```

Most times you will want to create a custom cell as well as most of the specific logic is here. What you have to do is subclassing Cell<ValueType>:

```swift
public class SwitchCell : Cell<Bool> {

    required public init(style: UITableViewCellStyle, reuseIdentifier: String?) {
        super.init(style: style, reuseIdentifier: reuseIdentifier)
    }

    public var switchControl: UISwitch? {
        return accessoryView as? UISwitch
    }

    public override func setup() {
        super.setup()
        selectionStyle = .None
        accessoryView = UISwitch()
        editingAccessoryView = accessoryView
        switchControl?.addTarget(self, action: "valueChanged", forControlEvents: .ValueChanged)
    }

    public override func update() {
        super.update()
        switchControl?.on = formRow.value ?? false
        switchControl?.enabled = !formRow.isDisabled
    }

    func valueChanged() {
        formRow.value = switchControl?.on.boolValue ?? false
    }
}
```

The setup and update methods are similar to the cellSetup and cellUpdate callbacks and that is where the cell should be customized.

Note: ValueType and CellType are illustrative. You have to replace them with the type your value will have and the type of your cell (like Bool and SwitchCell in this example)

### How to create custom inline rows

A inline row is a specific type of row that shows dynamically a row below it, normally an inline row changes between a expand and collapse mode whenever the row is tapped.

So to create a inline row we need 2 rows, the row that are "always" visible and the row that will expand/collapse.

Another requirement is that the value type of these 2 rows must be the same.

Once we have these 2 rows, we should make the top row type conforms to `InlineRowType` which will add some methods to the top row class type such as:

```swift
func expandInlineRow()
func hideInlineRow()
func toggleInlineRow()
```

Finally we must invoke `toggleInlineRow()` when the row is selected, for example overriding the customDidSelect() row method.

```swift
public override func customDidSelect() {
    toggleInlineRow()
}
```

### Implementing a custom Presenter row (SelectorRow, PushRow, ImageRow, etc) <a name="custom-presenter-row"></a>

**Note:** *A Presenter row is a row that presents a new UIViewController.*

To create a custom Presenter row you must create a class that conforms the `PresenterRowType` protocol. It is highly recommended to subclass `SelectorRow` as it does conform to that protocol and adds other useful functionality.

The PresenterRowType protocol is defined as followes:
```
public protocol PresenterRowType: TypedRowType {
    typealias ProviderType : UIViewController, TypedRowControllerType
    var presentationMode: PresentationMode<ProviderType>? { get set }
    var onPresentCallback: ((FormViewController, ProviderType)->())? { get set }
}
```

The onPresentCallback will be called when the row is about to present another view controller. This is done in the `SelectorRow` so if you do not sublass it you will have to call it yourself.

The `presentationMode` is what defines how the controller is presented and which controller is presented. This presentation can be using a Segue identifier, a segue class, presenting a controller modally or pushing to a specific view controller. For example a CustomPushRow can be defined like this:

```
public final class CustomPushRow<T: Equatable> : SelectorRow<T, SelectorViewController<T>>, RowType {

    public required init(tag: String?) {
        super.init(tag: tag)
        presentationMode = .Show(controllerProvider: ControllerProvider.Callback {
        	return SelectorViewController<T>(){ _ in }
        }, completionCallback: { vc in
        	vc.navigationController?.popViewControllerAnimated(true)
        })
    }
}
```

You can place your own UIViewController instead of SelectorViewController<T>.

## FAQ

#### How to get the value of a row?

The value of a row can be obtained with `row.value`. The type of this value is the type of the row (i.e. the value of a `PickerRow<String>` is of type `String`).

#### How to change the bottom navigation accessory view?

To change the behaviour of this you should set the navigation options of your controller. The `FormViewController` has a `navigationOptions` variable which is an enum and can have one or more of the following values:

- **Disabled**: no view at all
- **Enabled**: enable view at the bottom
- **StopDisabledRow**: if the navigation should stop when the next row is disabled
- **SkipCanNotBecomeFirstResponderRow**: if the navigation should skip the rows that return false to `canBecomeFirstResponder()`

The default value is `Enabled & SkipCanNotBecomeFirstResponderRow`

If you want to change the whole view of the bottom you will have to override the `navigationAccessoryView` variable in your subclass of `FormViewController`.

#### How to get a Row using its tag value

We can get a particular row by invoking any of the following functions exposed by the `Form` class:

```swift
public func rowByTag<T: Equatable>(tag: String) -> RowOf<T>?
public func rowByTag<Row: RowType>(tag: String) -> Row?
public func rowByTag(tag: String) -> BaseRow?
```

For instance:

```swift
let dateRow : DateRow? = form.rowByTag("dateRowTag")
let labelRow: LabelRow? = form.rowByTag("labelRowTag")

let dateRow2: Row<NSDate>? = form.rowByTag("dateRowTag")

let labelRow2: BaseRow? = form.rowByTag("labelRowTag")
```

#### How to get a Section using its tag value

```swift
let section: Section?  = form.sectionByTag("sectionTag")
```

#### How to get the form values

We can get all form values by invoking the following `Form` function:

```swift
public func values(includeHidden includeHidden: Bool = false) -> [String: Any?]
```

Passing `true` as `includeHidden` parameter value will also include the hidden rows values in the dictionary.

As you may have noticed the result dictionary key is the row tag value and the value is the row value. Only rows with a tag value will be added to the dictionary.

#### How to set the form values using a dictionary

Invoking `setValues(values: [String: Any?])` which is exposed by `Form` class.

For example:

```swift
form.setValues(["IntRowTag": 8, "TextRowTag": "Hello world!", "PushRowTag": Company(name:"Xmartlabs")])
```

Where `"IntRowTag"`, `"TextRowTag"`, `"PushRowTag"` are row tags (each one uniquely identifies a row) and `8`, `"Hello world!"`, `Company(name:"Xmartlabs")` are the corresponding row value to assign.

The value type of a row must match with the value type of the corresponding dictionary value otherwise nil will be assigned.

If the form was already displayed we have to reload the visible rows either by reloading the table view `tableView.reloadData()` or invoking `updateCell()` to each visible row.

#### Row does not update after changing hidden or disabled condition

After setting a condition, this condition is not automatically evaluated. If you want it to do so immediately you can call `.evaluateHidden()` or `.evaluateDisabled()`.

This functions are just called when a row is added to the form and when a row it depends on changes. If the condition is changed when the row is being displayed then it must be reevaluated manually.

#### onCellUnHighlight doesn't get called unless onCellHighlight is also defined

Look at this [issue](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Eureka/issues/96).
